# Get GitHub release information 

Allows you to get release information by: release id, tag, commit SHA (current commit or specified).

If release not found finishes with error.

## Inputs

Specify 1 input from the list to search release by:

* `releaseId` Release Id (number).
* `tag` Tag name.
* `commitSha` SHA of commit. Can be used to find a draft release.
* `releaseName` Release name. Returns most recent found. Can be used to find a draft release.
* `latest` Set `1` or `true` to get the latest non-draft release.
* `searchPrefix` will walk all releases and return the latest that has a matching prefix

If no inputs specified, the action will try to get release for the current commit SHA.

* `searchLimit` Optional, default: `90`. If you use `commitSha` or `releaseName` inputs you can 
also specify how many releases action should retrieve to perform a search. Specify more than 90 if
you age going to search for old releases and less if you want to speed up the search.

## Env variable

You should set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable to enable action to access GitHub API. See example.

## Outputs

* `html_url`
